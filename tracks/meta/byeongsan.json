	"comments": "Too hot to walk the open field even though we started early in the morning. As we started in the morning, we could get many shade in the mountain. Very steep at the start and downhill after reached the top. It was an hour course, however the steepness made us slow down. Some route was not cleared as noone used for a long time."
